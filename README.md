## Description

As a current student, I wanted to create a multiple choice quiz using JavaScript.  I accomplished this by creating a start area that allows the user to click a "Start Quiz" button to start the quiz and explains the rules of the quiz.  Once the user clicks on the "Start Quiz" button, the timer begins to count down from 60 seconds.  The next area takes the user to the first out of five questions.  For every incorrect answer, the timer lessens by 15 seconds and the score is deducted by 4 points.  For every correct answer, the user earns 4 points for a total of 20 possible points.

After clicking on an answer to a question, the user is taken to the next question until all five questions are answered.  When the user finishes answering all five questions, they are given their score and asked to enter their initials.  After the user enters their initials, the High Score area populates showing their initials and score.

## User Story

## Notes:

I received help from a tutor, [Scott Everett](https://calendly.com/fsf-tutor-team/scott-everett?month=2023-06).

I received help from multiple BCS Learning Assistants.

I received help from Instructors Kris and Malcolm.

I borrowed and changed code from user Emoses95 on this website [github.com](https://github.com/Emoses95/Code-Quiz/blob/main/assets/js/script.js) for coding the questions and answers.
